 Java and Java OOP 

java basic - datatype, variable, main method, conditional looping  

Java object oriented programming 

  runnable class - procedural programming - line by line - main method 

  non runnable class - any main method - functions - page object model - storage of functions 
  programming library - packages - non runnable classes - functions and properties 
   documentation - functions - what the functions are doing - input or outputs 


  non runnable class - prototype or design - design of a building 

  design - you implement the object 

  they have attirbutes - properties 
  they can do something - 

Person - 

John , Michael
Attributes - properties 
dl = 3443 , 21321
ssn = erew, fadsf
firstname = john, michael
last naem = bolton, john

can do - 
swim
run
write code
drive 


  bank account - 
attributes 

account number
account holder name
email - 



can do - 

  deposit
  withdraw
  submit information 


designing a java non runnable class - 
attributes - properties - what it can have 
functions - method - what it can do 

local and global variable 
this keyword - refers to global variable 
static - functions or properties part of the class and not part of the object 
constructor = constructor is used to setup initial value for an object 
constuctor overloading - multiple constructor in one class 
function overloading - same function with different inputs 

access modifier - public, private, protected, no modifier 
private - can not use it inside the package or outside package, inside the class
protected - can not be used outside of the package but can be used inside the pacakge
public - can use from inside or outside of the package 


arrary
exception 
inheritance
abstract class
interface 
features of the oop - polymorphism, abstraction, inherihance

functions - non runnable classes 
runnable class - main method of java - code starts from main method 

TestNG - testing 

web bases application - selenium 

can do anything within a web browser - chorme, IE, mozila firefox 

driver.get("url")

classname objetname = new classname()

webdriver driver=new chromedriver()

WebElement x = driver.findlement(by.xpath()); 

x.sendkeys()
class 

properties - global variable
functions - functions that can be executed 

constrcutro
global local
static

inheritance
abstract class
inteface 

refers to the relationship between class 

parent class - super class - will not get anything from child class or sub class

child class - sub class - properties and functions 

car 

sedan 

honda accord 

ha - honda accord, sedan, car

method overloading , constructor - can be in differnet forms depdning on their inputs 

4 features of Object oriented programming 

inheritance - capability of inheritating functions or properties from another class 
polymorphism - one object having differnet forms, also method and constructor overloading
abstraction - abstract class, private functions or properties 
encapsulation - having properties and functions ( data and action together) 

inheritance is important? 

bankaccount - depositm , withdraw 

chekcing account - get it from bankaccont

saving account - get it from bankaccount 

page object model - base class - common webelements or objects functions are in the base class

page object model class - inherits the base class 

webdriver driver; 

driver = new chromedriver(); 

extnes

method overriding - when child class function is overriding the parent class function 

super - is used to refer to parents class functions or constructor if child class wants to use

abstraction - one is creating abstract class 

abstract class - the class that we can not create an object, we can only use the functions or
properties 
through its child classes  

interface : making an outline of the some sets of classes 

defining what are the functions or properties sets of classes should have

webdriver driver = new chormedriver()

classname objectname = new classname()

interface - an outline for sets of classes, it can only have abstract function

the classes that are going to implement the interface, they need to implement all the functions
defined in the interface 

chromedriver, iedriver,firefoxdriver implementing the webdriver interface 

interfacename objectname = new classname(); 

abstract class vs interface 
basic programming - datatype, varibale, conditional, looping, function
OOP - class, objects, inheritance, interface, 
Data structure - array, list, hashmap, 
Algorithms - search, sorting 

array is a way of storing data 
store one data in one variable 
String x = "fdfasd"; 
x=12; 

exception vs error 

debugs 

int x [] = new int [5];
lenght of the array is 5 
the indexes of the arrary 0 1 2 3 4 

x[0]=12;
x[3]=39;
x[5]=56;

int y [] = new int [15]; 

0 - 14

integer memory if doesnt have value - 0 
string memory doesnt have value - null 
 

exception vs error 

complie time exception - error in the code 

run time exception 

no such element exception - wrong locating tecnique, your code is taking
null pointer exception - providing wrong location for something
stale element excpetion - happens when the web elements is not avialble in the memory

only one exception we can accept and try to run the code again without chaning anything 

there is a bug in the application that we are testing - 

assertion excpetion - application defects or bugs 
tries compare actual and expected and it doesn't match 

code and application 

code is what we are writing to test the application, to find if there is problem in the 
application or bug/defects 

100 automation test scripts - 5 of your scripts failed 

sytem.out.println(

how to handle exception? 

just to make sure the code is running 

handling exception 

try catch finally 

try - finds the excpetion 
catch - find the name of the exception
finally - we can execute some code after exception
