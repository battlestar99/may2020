Eclipse : 

1. eclipse companion library missing - 

2. jre error with exit code - 13

jdk but not having jre 

Installation 

jdk - compiler 

jre - java runtime environment + java core library 
jre - running any java software 
java core library - without this you can not write your own code 

eclipse - where you are going to write your code? - editor 
eclipse is an intelligent editor for programming 

What is a programming language? 

its a language understood by the computer - java, c, python, c# 

a lanugage understood by the computer which can give some instruction to the computer 

compiler / interpreter 

maching lagnuage - 101011010101010

What we do in programming? 

code Syntax - grammar of the code 

set of instructions given to the computer - solve some problem

1. data 
2. conditions 
3. repeat 

you are hungry ? 

eat - burger 
what time you want to it- time - data
can you eat now? if my instructor allows me to eat 

java, how to store data and use it? number, name, random name, specific number of digits, food name

datatype variable = data 

15 - you have to make a memory space in your computer 
burger - you have to make a memory space in your computer 


integer > int can store any whole number - 10
string > String
double can store any decimal number 

// declaring a variable 
int x ; 
int z;  
String name; 
double y; 

// initializing a variable 

x = 20; 
z=50;
x=14;

x+z;

name = "michael";

Rule 1 : Java is a case sensitive language - A is differnet for a
int Int

Rule 2: when you are naming something, dont give any space , variable, class, method 

int ac

Java class - single unit of java code 
create a class - 

public class classname{
 public static void main(String args[]){




}


}

main method - starting point of executing your code, also  makes any class runnable 
scope - class, methods, control statments are scope 

starting point and ending point - { } 
method - {}
control statment - {}

statement : ends with a ;

integer, boolean, String 
datatype variablename = variablevalue; 

int count = 100; 
double x = 25.25; 

String carplate = "virginia";

// declaretion and initialization at the same time 
boolean flag = true; 

true false
// 

int count; 

count = 24; 







how to create java class and main method? 
datatype variable and data?
rule; java case sensitive, dont give space in name



data 

control statment> 
conditional
repeat 





Problem: 

we need to create a car payment calculator? 

requirements of the problem: 

carprice, admin fee, warrenty, downpayment, installment, 

interest rate 
700 > 2 
650> 4 
650< 5 
credit score 

tax 

15 percent of 200 - 15 


15/100 X 200

2 percnet of 2000 

2/100 X 2000 + 2000

1. Homework - 3/4 programming problems + questions that you have to write answers

2. use all the codes we are doing in the class
