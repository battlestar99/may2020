Java Interface - interface vs abstract class 

abstract class - normal class, you can not create an object 
sub class - child class 
inheritance 

sub class - super class 

abstract bankaccount - deposit, withdraw, checkamount 
sub class - checkingaccount, savingaccount, investmentaccount 

java interface  - set of outlines for other classes 

Cucumber - 

TestNG - 
web based application testing - java, selenium 

why need TestNG? 

java - programming language - computer understands - jdk
selenium - java - interact with the browser and web elements 
TestNG/cucumber - testing library/testing framework - coding template 
specifically used for testing

organize the code in testing basis - reqs, steps, post req, iteration
pass/fail scenrio - expected and actual result - assert(expected, actual)
report - 
data driven testing
parallel testing 
priority, depends on method, grouping 


TestNG > Cucumber 

TestNG/Junit > traditional type testing framework > unit testing > non-technical person

product devleopment - 
project management
team lead 
business analyst 
testers - manual testing, automation testing 
developers - code 

reason 1 : non technical person can understand automation testing 
cucumber - bdd - beahvour driven testing/development 
we test the behaviour of the application 

gherkin language 

java library - 
setup - 
jar files - 10 different jar files 
eclipse plugin - 

TestNG / Cucumber Plugin - attached with eclipse 

libraries - jar files - attached with the project 


Cucumber - 

feature file - gherkin language - plain english language to write app behaviour 
understaable to everyone technical / non technical 
plain english language using gherkin keywords 

gherkin keywords/language  - 
feature - test scripts 
scenerio- test case 
background 

given
when
and
then
but 

step definition - will execute the tests 

Test Runners - 

@Test
public void validatesignup(){

// code getting executed 

}
1. we can not implement the same step mutiple time
we can use it multiple time 

2.
