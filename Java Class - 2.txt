Java Class - 2 

anik@agile1tech.com 

jdk + eclipse editor 

class is the single unit that we need to create for writing any java code 
 2 types of class in java - OOP 
class - main method - run the class 
class - no main method - not able to run the class 

public class mortagecalculator{

public static void main(String args[]){



}

}





OOP - java library - class - object - function

class - main method/main function - we can run it - runnable class 
if we want to execute the code - 

non-runnable class - no main method - we can not run it - non-runnable class 
method / function 
properties - global variables - attributes of the class 

function: 
1. lines of codes that get executed upon called 
2. functions holds codes that is re-usuable 

function can do specific things - 

as a programmar we can create functions
or we can use other people function that is already created 

what to learn about function : 

1. how to create a function 

2. how to use a function 
 a. function created by yourself 

 b. function created by some other programers 


input > function > output 

parameters, arguments > functtion > return / return type 



I am going to create a function that can add two numbers


public outputdatatype functionname(inputs ......){



}

how to create an object of a class 

classname objectname = new classname(); 



functions we create in non-runnable class
functions we use from runnable class , non-runnable class 

public boolean checkvalue(String x, double y){



}



Functions - return 
boolean > 

int, string, boolean 

why 
how 

1. how to create a function 

2. how to use a function 
 a. function created by yourself 

 b. function created by some other programers - library - selenium, testng, cucumber

Java - programming lanaguage - jdk > java core library + jre > data, conditions, repeation 

functions 

how to create a function

public int getNumber(String x, boolean y, int z) {

// write your code here 

return 34; 


}

// out put will be one string and input will be 2 numbers 
// your function will return "number1 is larger than number2" if number1 is larger than number2 
so you have to tak two numbers as input and compare them 

number1 = 50
number2 = 20 

public String getcomparision(int number1, int number2){

String x = "test";

if (number1>number2){

x="number1 is larger than number2";

}

else{

x="number1 is not larger than number2";

}

return x; 




}




How to use a function: 

1. from which class the function is coming 

2. creating an object of the class > object is a copy of the class 


if a webelemet in present in the page, a function will check it an return true, if the webelement is not
presnet in the page, the function will return false 


OOP 
local variables > global variables 
static vs non-static 

// non-static function
// static function










functions > proecedural programming , traditional progamming 
function is a procedure we create to use again and again,

function > Object oriented programming, 
what an object can do is a function
what an object can hold is a property 





class is a prototype or design of a system used by the objects 

class is design of a building - class , doors, windows, scale,  

100 building - objects are implementation of a design 

OOP - 

you have some attribues > properties - global variables 
you can do something > run, walk, computer programming - functions 







programming library - 
3rd party library -whatever not coming from jdk 
core java library comes from jdk 

library - connect a specific version of remote with my car 

library - I can share that with all other programmers 

web bases application testing - interaction web application 

library - jar file 
packages > classes/non runnable classes> functions 

selenium library - jar files > all the functions we need for interacting with web browser
