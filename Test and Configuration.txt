rare in the project - 


Test management and configuration - 
build managment system - why and how - which one
version and repository system - why and how - which one 
remote server - run our tests from remote server - why and how - 


managing your code working in a team, lead/manager whats their role in automation testing 

reponsibilities : 

1. write automated test cases / test scripts and run them for regression, uat, smoke 

sturcture - TestNG , cucumber 

java project -TestNG - guico signp, dot - fimsr
packages 
Tests -signup.guico.tests , fimsr.dot.tests
page object model - guico.pages, fimsr.dot.pages 
xml - test suites or data 
utility - common function you can create to use  - guico.uitilies

cucumber 
pacakges 
step-def - guico.stepdef
features - data table for data driven framework - signupTest
page object model 
test runner - suite 

build managment system to organize our project - version control system to share our projects
- CI/CD pipeline to run our project from remote server 

1. build managment - maven, ant, gradle 
no need to download the jar files - pom.xml - dependency/programming library managment 
depency of the project - libraries 
import the project - 
maven commands to build/run/test the project - run from remote server 

2. sharing our code - having multiple version of the code 
Git - technology , software for version control and upload code in a repository 
github, bitbucket - repository

3. 
when you are running your script in your computer - local compuer 

500 test scripts - everyday 

remote server - to connnected with the tests - CI/CD pipeline 
contineous integration and contineious development 

server - difference between local and remote server 


when we should test? 

applications code - development code changes 

and these changes are deployed to the server - you should test 

any code changes in your application - you should test it 
you might not see any different from front-end




Maven - Build management system 

archtype - specific template for creating java project 

pom.xml 

project object model 




maven, git , jenkins 

java - widely used 

java project vs maven project 

Java project - downloading all the jar files - selenium, testng, cucumber
this project no one can import - folder 
src, 
TestNG - TestNG Test, xml - TestNG Suite - TesTNG 
tesscripts, page objects, utitlies, xml
Cucumber - Feature - one feature file, TestRunner - test suites, multiples features together
features, stepdef, testrunner, utitlies, page obejcts- Report 

Maven Project - pom.xml - we can define the depencies pom.xml, .m2  
anyone can import the project 
src/test/java 

tesscripts, page objects, utitlies, xml - 2 ways 

features, stepdef, testrunner, utitlies, page obejcts - feature, test runner 

maven have some commands to run scripts and do some more things 
maven install - install all the dependcies 
maven build - compound commands - install + test 
maven test - src/test/java - apptest.java
maven clean - cleaning the output folders 
maven generate-source - this is creating jar files for libraries 

maven test - remote server , CI/CD piplelines 

xml, test runner 

build managment systems commands - 
jenkins - maven test

dependcies - libraries , jar files 
plugin - giving specific functionalities to maven

        </plugin>


<suiteXmlFile>src/test/resources/runner/testng.xml</suiteXmlFile>









single test - testng test 
multiple test - test suite - xml 
maven test - point to the specific xml to run 


jenkins - maven test 

You want to share your project - to the github 

Git - you can make a folder as a git folder - git starts tracking everything happenening 
in that folder 

the folder is in your local - 

you can push it to remote for sharing - 

version control using git - 
sharing our code - version control 

local repo - in our computer 
remote repo - github, company repository 

local repo > remote repo 

changes you are doing in local - you can upload it, you can push it to remote 
git push -u origin master 

1. project is already in github repo 
download the project - maven 
import it in your eclipse
you start working on that 

you have to push the code to the remote 

git init - to create git repo in a folder 
git add * - to add any unadded file in the track
git commit - commiting or saving a specific version

https://github.com/battlestar99/gitMayTest.git

git push is uploading your code 

2. you have to create from scratch
